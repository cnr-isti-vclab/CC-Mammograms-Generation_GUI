In the folders 'normal_mammograms,' 'benign_mammograms,' 'malignant_mammograms,' and 'mixed_mammograms,' you will find the mammograms from our selected dataset, taken from the Categorized Digital Database for Low Energy and Subtracted Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography images (CDD-CESM) [1], which is publicly available in the Cancer Imaging Archive [2]. From these images we extracted the breast shape parameters using the functions in the folder "breast_profile_parameters_extraction".

NOTE: These are the original mammograms, but for the training phase, the images from the 'all_mammograms' folder, after applying the 'from_mammo_to_512x512' function, were used.
